An express based app for creating a membership/subscription site with [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com/signup), mongodb and swig. Inspired by [sahat/hackathon-starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) and [RailsApps/rails-stripe-membership-saas](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-stripe-membership-saas).

#### [angular-select-text](https://github.com/eddywashere/angular-select-text)

An angular directive for selecting text content on click. Why? Some people prefer not to add flash to their site to enable copy to clipboard.
The next best thing is to make it easier to select a block of content with 1 simple click.
